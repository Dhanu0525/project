# Project-
Today finding right content regarding trending and intresting topics on the internet is one of the most difficult and time consuming process. 
With growing web content, it is tedious to follow precise information and get the content which exactly matters us the most. In this 
project, using the Wordpress APIs, I will be filtering out content specific to the user depending on his interests and will give 
him related content suggestions. As web mining is a huge topic, I will be focusing only on blogs. For this purpose, I have chosen WordPress
as our research blogging platform as it is the most widely used blogging platform throughout the world. There are millions wordpress blogger
s writing everyday. This project not only searches/crawls on blogs hosted on wordpress.org but also on custom domains running wordpress as 
CMS in the backend. I will be using WordPress's RESTful APIs to collect the data.
